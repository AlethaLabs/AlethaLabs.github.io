### What's This About?

**Aletha Labs** is a personal research platform founded by Chris, dedicated to exploring and sharing knowledge in cybersecurity and programming. Named after Chris's great grandmother, whose middle name was derived from the ancient word *Aletheia* meaning ***truth***, this space embodies the pursuit of authentic learning and discovery in technology.

### Why Aletha Labs Exists

Navigating the ***vast ocean of tech*** as a newcomer can be intimidating. Rather than scattering thoughts across generic platforms or social media, Chris needed a dedicated space to thoroughly document research and learning. With a background rooted in construction and farming, the drive to ***build and grow*** is fundamental - and this platform represents that philosophy applied to the digital realm.

### The Vision

Aletha Labs aims to evolve into a collaborative space where both ***experienced professionals and newcomers*** can:

- Share research and findings
- Create programs together that change the tech landscape
- Build and grow as a community
- Document authentic learning journeys

Whether you're a seasoned expert or just starting your cybersecurity journey, Aletha Labs serves as a resource for learning and knowledge sharing at the intersection of code and security.

### About Chris

Chris brings a unique perspective to cybersecurity, combining a strong background in farming and construction with a passion for technology. His entire adult life has been spent working in both fields, where:

- **Farming** taught him patience, resilience, and the value of hard work
- **Construction** developed hands-on problem-solving skills and a mindset for building from the ground up

Now channeling that same work ethic and curiosity into cybersecurity, Chris is actively learning:

- **Python, Rust, and C programming**
- **Linux systems administration**
- **Security tools and methodologies**

As someone who learns best by doing, Chris believes in building projects, experimenting with system tools, and tackling challenges that push the boundaries of growth.
